We hope that this information will help to point you in the              right direction of some of the sources of funding which may              be available to help families with disabled children. We can’t              guarantee that you’ll be eligible for everything listed here, so              please contact the relevant organisation directly to explain              your circumstances and make sure it is worth your while to              apply, and to make sure the information we have given is still              correct as many of these things change frequently.              The majority of the information in this pack refers to England,              Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In the instances where we              are aware of a different situation, we have tried to make this clear.               When your child reaches the age of 16, they are entitled to              claim certain benefits in their own name. However, it is very              important that you seek proper advice about whether they              should get benefits in their own right, or whether you will be              better off as a family if you continue to claim on their behalf if              they are still in full-time education.               If you would like to discuss benefits and entitlements in              general, you can contact Little Hearts Matter, your congenital              cardiac specialist nurse or hospital social worker. Other              general sources of information are your local Citizens Advice,              social services, your child’s community nurse, a specialist              health visitor or the nurses and health care assistants on              hospital wards. It can be worth chatting to these people to find              out whether they have any ideas or experience.               This information is correct to the best of our knowledge at the              time of going to press, but is not a guarantee of an individual              family’s eligibility for funding. To check your eligibility, please              contact the organisations directly.         4","General living                 Use the tool on the government website to help work out what              you can claim - www.gov.uk/benefits-calculators.
